We are the team Electro4worm !

We decided to work on the influence of electric fields on C. elegans, but our project turned out to be way more diverse and we studied the influence of electric fields on many different organisms. These observations were compared to the sensitivity of a magnetometer when exposed to.. an electric field !

You can find our Labbook and project proposal in the Project_proposal folder, our arduino code in the Arduino folder and finally our data and data analysis python code in the the Data analysis folder.
