In order to do a fractal analysis, we had to use an ImageJ plugin, called Fractal count.

To measure the fractal number thanks to this plugin, you must first focus on a part of your photo, the cleanest part that you can find in your photo, and apply different image modifications :

-Image : Type : 8 bit
--> to make the image in shades of grey

-Process : Binary : Make binary
--> Makes the photo black and white (with the background in white)

if there is too much noise, try to :
-Process : Binary : Skeletonize or Erode.

Then go to plugin and click on Fractalcount, there you go ! your fractal number.
